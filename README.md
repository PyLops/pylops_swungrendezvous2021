# PyLops at Swung Rendesvouz 2021

Material for **Solving geophysical inverse problems on GPUs with PyLops+cupy** event,
to be given at [Swung Rendesvouz 2021](https://softwareunderground.org/events/2021/2/26/rendezvous-matteo-ravasi) course.


The material covered in this event includes a slide deck and 2 jupyter notebooks. Participants can either use:

- local Python installation (follow this set of instructions
[1](https://pylops.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html),
[2](https://pylops.readthedocs.io/en/latest/performance.html), and
[3](https://pylops.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gpu.html)
to setup your environment)
- a Cloud-hosted environment such as Google Colab (use links provided below to open the notebooks
directly in Colab).
